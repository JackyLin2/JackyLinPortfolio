                <p> Hi! My name is Jacky Lin and I am a software engineer based in New York, NY.  </p>
                 <p>   
                    I graduated from Flatiron Bootcamp in June of 2020. Through my time at Flatiron I was able to learn Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript and React.
                    I enjoy creating websites and application and my goal is to always be better than who I was yesterday. During my free time I enjoy playing basketball, hiking,
                    and working out. 
                </p>
                <p>Please reach out to me if you would like to work together on a project!   </p>
            </div>
