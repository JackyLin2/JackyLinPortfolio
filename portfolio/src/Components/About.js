                <p> My name is Jacky Lin and I recently graduated from Flatiron Bootcamp to become a Full Stack Web Developer. At Flatiron I was able to create projects using 
                    various languages, frameworks and libraries such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript and React. My road to becoming a full stack developer has only begun, I am 
                    excited to create more projects and apply what I know to the real world </p>
